# Homelab Wiki

This wiki is for documenting *every single step* I am taking in setting up my own homelab so that it can be replicated if required. It's worth noting that there are a couple sections in this wiki that are not strictly to do with homelabbing, but nonetheless has been a valuable lesson I've learned in the process.
